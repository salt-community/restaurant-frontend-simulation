# Restaurant Frontend Simulation

# 👨‍🍳🍳 restaurant-frontend-simulation 🍲👨‍🍳
## Introduction
As part of a two-week upskill project in Apache Kafka we have created a restaurant app consisting of four microservices:

- [Order Service](https://github.com/salt-community/restaurant-order-service)
- [Payment Service](https://github.com/salt-community/restaurant-payment-service)
- [Delivery Service](https://github.com/salt-community/restaurant-delivery-service)
- [Kitchen Service](https://github.com/salt-community/restaurant-kitchen-service)

This is a simple frontend intended to visualize the backend flow.
